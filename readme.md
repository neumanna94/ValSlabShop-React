## Introduction
Val Slab shop is a website that I plan to develop over several years. As I hope to use it to try to solve complicated web development and business problems such as how to most effectively manage orders/contact so that this website can be used effectively to make a profit for a small compnay in Oregon.
List of Specifications:
<ol>
  <li> Display Slab Inventory </li>
  <li> Display Individual Slab Detail[In Progress]</li>
  <li> Display Contact Page </li>
  <li> Display Landing Page </li>
  <li> Allow an admin user to add slabs to website dynamically[In Progress] </li>
  <li> Notify admin/business owner when a contact request is generated[In Progress] </li>
</ol>
I am still mastering React so the structure of my project will likely change and I might approach this project entirely differently in the next few weeks to months..

  Currently ,this application does not utilize state, however in version two, which will be submitted for the second week it will   implemenet state and allow the admin user to manage slabs, and contact requests.
